### 1. Overview
This course is the first quarter of a three-quarter long introduction to numerical analysis. Numerical
analysis is a broad field concerned with solving mathematics problems using finite precision arith-
metic on computers. Our principal focus will be on techniques for the representation of piecewise
smooth functions of one variable. That is, we will discuss how we can, given the ability to evaluate
a function f (x), calculate a finite amount of information which enables us to evaluate f (x) at any
point we wish. This is a basic and important task which must be undertaken by essentially all nu-
merical procedures. We will also discuss the numerical integration and differentiation of piecewise
smooth functions of one variable, topics which are closely connected to schemes for representing
them.
